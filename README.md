# UnrealRustGameGenerator
a desktop/mobile app that generates UnrealEngine/Rust Game with Solana Marketplace

a rust script that expands the text into source code on given language

    ./expand -i UnrealRustGameGenerator/README.md -o .build/UnrealRustGameGenerator.rs.git
    
a rust script that concatenates all rust files in the repo the way they could be compiled

    ./concat -i .build/UnrealRustGameGenerator.rs.git -o .build/UnrealRustGameGenerator.rs.git/.build/UnrealRustGameGenerator~ConCated.rs
   
a rust script that splits a concatenated unmarked mixed function order no complex macro source code on Rust language into the structured Rust repository of files, with filepaths and names guessed (use llm for guessing: "here is the list of the files in the repository. here is the {function/variable/struct}. output the name of the file where they should be placed; if you think new file should be created, output NEW {full_filename_including_directory}")

    ./split -i .build/UnrealRustGameGenerator.rs.git/.build/UnrealRustGameGenerator~ConCated.rs -o .build/UnrealRustGameGenerator~Autogenerated~UUID.rs.git
